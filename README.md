# ckb-auth
A consolidated library featuring numerous blockchains authentication techniques
on CKB-VM. More details in [auth.md](./docs/auth.md). 
We also write a repository to demonstrate how to use this library:
[ckb-auth-example](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth-examples).


## Motivation
The [CKB-VM](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm) in CKB has provided a
multitude of advanced smart contract functionalities that are not typically
found within other blockchain networks. CKB presents a seamless solution for
implementing blockchain interoperability. Through the utilization of ckb-auth, a
sophisticated smart contract library, users can effortlessly access CKB assets
from alternate blockchain wallets, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, without the use
of a CKB wallet. 

To illustrate, considering a scenario where Alice only possesses an Ethereum
wallet, Bob can transmit assets, including CKB or NFT, to Alice. With the
application of ckb-auth, Alice can effectively utilize and transfer these assets
using her Ethereum wallet without requiring the creation of a CKB wallet
throughout the process.

## Integration
The following blockchains are supported:

* [Bitcoin](./docs/bitcoin.md)
* [Ethereum](./docs/ethereum.md)
* [EOS](./docs/eos.md)
* [Tron](./docs/tron.md)
* [Dogecoin](./docs/dogecoin.md)
* CKB
* [Litecoin](./docs/litecoin.md)
* [Cardano](./docs/cardano.md)
* [Monero](./docs/monero.md)
* [Solana](./docs/solana.md)
* [Ripple](./docs/XRP.md)

## Build

``` bash
git submodule update --init
make all-via-docker
```
For more details, please check out [CI script](./.github/workflows/rust.yml).

## Test

All test case commands are located in `tests/Makefile`.

### Installing Dependencies

```shell
make install_all
```

### Running All Tests
```bash
cd tests && make all_tests
```

## Test with Spawn (activated after hardfork 2023)
Before running test cases with spawn support, please install ckb-debugger for next hardfork:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger ckb-debugger
```
Then run:

```bash
cd tests/auth_spawn_rust && make all
```
