```

* `ckb-auth` functions as a library for other contracts to invoke. For testing purposes, a comprehensive contract has been implemented to test `auth-c-lock` and `auth-rust-lock`.
* In `auth-rust-lock`, a straightforward test exists to assess `ckb-auth-rs`.
* `auth-c-tests` tests the ckb-auth library, encompassing various scenarios.
* `auth-spawn-tests` utilizes ckb-debugger to conduct tests on typical scenarios, including those for cardano and ripple.
* The `bin` directory is not part of the repository. It is a temporary directory created post the `make install-all` command.
* Tools are installed in the `bin` directory, as a specific version is required here to avoid conflicts.
* Post-installation, two files, namely `.crates.toml` and `.crates2.json`, are generated by cargo.
